If you are using BIGTREETECH SKR Mini E3 motherboard for your Ender, you may have noticed an SPI connector on it. At this moment Marlin only supports a few thermocouple sensor chips on it.

This project adds two 10-bit analog inputs over SPI

### Roadmap:
- [x] PCB
- [ ] Firmware
- [ ] Schematics and Marlin path for using this PCB as additional NTC temperature sensor controller
